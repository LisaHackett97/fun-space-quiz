#### As site owner I want

- To provide a fun, interactive site that is easy to navigate, and can be viewed on different screen sizes.
- The user to enjoy playing the game.
- Give some interesting facts and information on the subject.
- Provide form for users to ask a question or tell us what they know.

### Strategy and scope

Looking at both strategy and scope of the project, I referred back to the user stories, which helped in planning out the project.
On the strategy plane, I did research looking at basic games, quizzes and information relevant to the topic. I also did some research by asking children I know what they like about space. I identified what worked well and not so well from a UX perspective, including colours and how interesting or unusual information is for the user.
Colours and interesting inforFor my site, I listed out the opportunities/problems and how each of these might be addressed.
And for the scope plane, I planned out the content and functional requirements.

### Structure of the website

The structure of the site is designed so that on landing on the site, the user can easily go straight 
to the game or if they wish, can go to the learn more page, where they can view images/facts about Space and also contact the site owner. Easy to use nav bar to be included on game page and learn more page, from which the user can access the game, view the gallery images and contact the site owner.
